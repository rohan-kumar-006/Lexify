## ⚖️ Lexify – A Legal Q&A Platform

Lexify is a legal discussion platform that allows users to post their legal queries and get responses from registered lawyers. It's designed to be minimal, easy to use, and accessible to both clients and legal professionals.

## 🌟 Features

- Post legal questions under different categories
- Verified lawyers can answer the queries
- Two types of authentication:
  - Local (username/password)
  - Google OAuth 2.0
- Clean UI built with EJS
- MongoDB for data storage
- Role-based content rendering (Lawyer / Client)
- Displays user profile picture

## 💡 Inspiration

There are forums for tech, health, and everything else—but legal questions often go unanswered. Lexify aims to bridge this gap with a dedicated platform.  
Fun fact: A seemingly simple idea—displaying the Google profile picture—ended up taking hours and taught me a lot about session handling and serialization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
